<h2>Music</h2>

  Here is the viola part to Mozart's "Kegelstatt" trio (K. 498)
transcribed for B-flat clarinet as well as treble clef.  Basically,
some friends and I wanted to play this piece, which was written for
violin or clarinet, viola, and piano, but what we actually had was
flutes, a clarinet, and a piano, hence the transcription.
