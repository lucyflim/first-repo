  <h2>Making Firefox session files legible and searchable</h2>
  <p>
  Firefox stores session information in .jsonlz4 files which are 100% not human-readable.
 On a Mac, these files can be found in the Firefox profile directory:
  <pre>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*profile name*/sessionstore-backups/recovery.jsonlz4
~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*profile name*/sessionstore.jsonlz4</pre>
  </p>
  <h3>Method 1 (two-step decompression and html conversion)</h3>
Python code (not my code) to <a href="https://gist.github.com/mirogula/de2e5cf5303b815b272c">convert Firefox saved session information 
  (now in recovery.jsonlz4) to html</a>. 
  <ul>
  <li>Step 1 is now to uncompress the Firefox .jsonlz4 file (compressed in a weird LZ4 format, for reasons known only to Mozilla) 
  to a normal json file.  One way to do this is with the firefox extension "mozlz4-edit" which will export to a suitable text format
  via "Save as JSON".  Another way is to use <a href="https://gist.github.com/kaefer3000/73febe1eec898cd50ce4de1af79a332a">mozlz4a.py</a>:
  <pre> $ python3 mozlz4a.py -d recovery.jsonlz4 recovery_json.txt</pre>
  <p>
    <li>Step 2 is to convert the resulting text (JSON) file to human-readable HTML:
<pre>$ python session2html.py -s recovery_json.txt -o recovery-pagelist.html
  </pre>
  </ul><p> @mirogula's <a href="https://gist.github.com/mirogula/de2e5cf5303b815b272c">session2html</a>
  was based in turn on <a href="https://gist.github.com/warner/2690106">@warner's make-html.py</a>.
  These earlier codes worked on the uncompressed JSON files as produced by earlier versions of Firefox.
  </p>
  <h3>Method 2</h3>
  <p>
  I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/lucyflim/www/blob/master/session2htmlp3.py">revised Python script</a> 
   to do the .jsonlz4 decompression and HTML output in one step (adapting code from session2html
  and following the example in @tblue's and @kaefer3000's 
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/kaefer3000/73febe1eec898cd50ce4de1af79a332a">mozlz4a.py</a>
  for the decompression step). Use python3 for this version:
  <pre>$ python3 session2htmlp3.py -s recovery.jsonlz4 -o recovery-pagelist.html</pre>
   All this assumes you've gotten a copy of your python code and a copy of the .jsonlz4 file in the same directory - otherwise
  you'll have to include the file paths.

<h2>Music</h2>

  Here is the viola part to Mozart's "Kegelstatt" trio (K. 498)
transcribed for B-flat clarinet as well as treble clef.  Basically,
some friends and I wanted to play this piece, which was written for
violin or clarinet, viola, and piano, but what we actually had was
flutes, a clarinet, and a piano, hence the transcription.
