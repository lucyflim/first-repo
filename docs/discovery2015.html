<b>Discovery-related:</b>  NASA <a href="http://discovery.nasa.gov/program.cfml">Discovery</a> Step-1 proposals 
were due in February 2015.   My colleagues and I were hard at work writing them for several months beforehand!
It's fun to think up new space missions and how to achieve the best possible science within a limited budget.
Here are some of the conference abstracts describing our efforts:

<li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/people/lucylim/lim_etal_lpsc2015_2856.pdf">Measuring Bulk Carbon, Hydrogen, and Sulfur from Orbit: 
Modeling Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Asteroids.</a>  <p> How much ice and carbon-rich material is 
really in all those dark ("low-albedo") asteroids?  What meteorites might they be related to?   
Can we use a gamma-ray spectrometer on an 
asteroid orbiter to find out?   Yes, we can.

Mission to Investigate the Two Moons of Mars. </a>
<p> Surprisingly, we still don't actually know where the moons of Mars came from.  This mission 
will use a neutron spectrometer and a mass spectrometer to find out what kind of rock they are made of, which
we don't know either.
