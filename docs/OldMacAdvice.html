with Mac OS X Panther</a>.  From a Linux and emacs user's
perspective.</p>
<p>Update (2005): <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100728151335/http://stuff.mit.edu/people/lucylim/MacRecovery.html">Recovering all my OS X
stuff</a> after a hard drive mechanical failure.  Backups are your
friend.  The problem, though, was that my stuff was backed up on a lot
of different CDs and took a ridiculous amount of time to restore.  I
think I'm going to buy a hard drive and external enclosure to make my
life easier next time.
