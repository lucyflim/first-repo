<h4>Backing up to an External Firewire Drive</h4>
Equipment:
<ul>
  <li>One Seagate Backup Plus portable drive</li>
  <li>One Seagate STAE102 "FreeAgent GoFlex Upgrade Cable FireWire 800"</li>
</ul>
Steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Used "Disk Utility" to establish a GUID partition table for the Seagate.
</li>
  <li>Used "Disk Utility" to establish at least one HFS+ 
(Mac OS Extended (Journaled), NOT case-sensitive) on the Seagate.
</li>
  <li>Again using "Disk Utility", "restore" the Mac drive to the
external journaled partition.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you run the "Disk Utility" off the OS X disc (that is,
booting your Mac off of the disc instead of your hard drive and then
running it) you can automatically make the external backup
bootable.&nbsp; Otherwise it won't necessarily be, but you can fix that
(see below).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>To update the backups, use rsync.
      (Caution:  following this method as described will erase
everything else on the backup volume.)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
<a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/mac-osx-bootable-backup-drive-with-rsync/">
nicholasgallagher.com</a> provides a good shell-script wrapper for the rsync
command.  It handles stuff like checking the readability/writeability 
of the drives beforehand and incorporates an exclusion list and all the 
appropriate flags into the rsync call. 
</li>
    <li>For best results, before running this the stock OS X rsync
should be updated, like <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/17210439#17210439">this</a>:
<pre><code>
Just d/l it from http://rsync.samba.org/ and compile as follows:

Download and unarchive rsync and its patches

          Move patches directory to rsync-3.0.9
          cd rsync-3.0.9

Apply patches relevant to preserving Mac OS X metadata

          patch -p1 &lt;patches/fileflags.diff
          patch -p1 &lt;patches/crtimes.diff

Apply patch relevant to preserving Mac OS X hfs+compression

          patch -p1 &lt;patches/hfs-compression.diff

Configure, make, install

        ./prepare-source
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

Verify your installation

          rsync --version

By default, rsync will be installed in /usr/local/bin. If that isn't 
in your path, you will need to call your new version of rsync by its 
absolute path (/usr/local/bin/rsync).
</code>
</pre>

This version will allow the --hfs-compression and --protect-decmpfs
flags to work.  The actual rsync line will then include these two
flags which will avert a certain amount of "bloat" in the backup
volume (see <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4177844?start=0&tstart=0">here</a>).
</li>

  <li>
Gallagher's script includes the "bless" command, which looks like this:
<pre>$ sudo bless -folder "/Volumes/Backup/System/Library/CoreServices/" </pre>
</li>
<li>
At the very end after rebooting from the new drive, it is necessary to
enter one final command to get rid of the "dyld: shared cached file"
error messages:
<pre>$ sudo update_dyld_shared_cache -force</pre>
</li>
</ul><br>

Now it's a bootable mirror!  Yay!<br>
