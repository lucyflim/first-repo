		<h3>Using BibDesk to organize PDFs of research papers</h3>
<p>
The basic problem is described by Olivia Judson in 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100616150150/http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/defeating-bedlam/">this
article</a>.  If you've ever had 85 files on your computer entitled
"sdarticle121.pdf" and no idea what is in any of them, you will
understand.  
</p>
<p>
Dr. Judson highlighted two pieces of software that solved her problem:
<a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and 
<a href="http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a>.  Zotero is a Firefox
extension, which I'll return to in a bit, but it's more about gathering
new papers (and making those new papers easier to keep organized) than
about organizing things you already have.  
</p>
<p>
Papers, on the other hand, seemed like the tool I'd been looking for, and
it's used and loved by other scientists I know.  However, before deciding
to pony up the $40, I did a bit of Googling 
("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software">reference management software</a>" was a winner) 
to investigate the alternatives.
</p>
<h3> BibDesk</h3>
<h4>"Like iTunes for your PDF collection"</h4>
<p>
It turned out that the open-source 
<a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/">BibDesk</a> 
could do everything I wanted, for free. Plus,
it stores all its information in the BibTeX format, which
(a) is human-readable, so even if the BibDesk project goes bust 
someday, you will still have all the bibliographic information
available, and
(b) I already had all my bibliographies in anyway.  I just had to open
my existing .bib files from within BibDesk, then match up the .pdf 
files with the right .bib entries.  (BibDesk will let you "link" as 
many files and/or URLs as you want to one bibliographic entry.  The
newer versions also keep track of the "Mac OS aliases" of the linked
files, so you can move them around in Finder or whatever, and BibDesk
will still know where they are.  It's an awesome feature.)
</p>
<p>
This is pretty great, but it's still kind of tedious opening up
a zillion BibDesk entries and hunting for each matching .pdf file.  I ended
up adapting 
<!-- <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/bibdesk/index.php?title=BibDesk_Applescripts"> -->
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/bibdesk/wiki/BibDesk_Applescripts/">
	other people's Applescripts</a> 
to make it easier.  My
personal filing system had previously been to create filenames
including the year, journal name, and first author, so I wrote an
applescript that called Unix "locate" to look for those.
But actually the most effective approach for recent PDFs 
(especially the ones with cryptic filenames such as "sdarticleXX.pdf") was to use
an applescript to call 
the Unix tools "pdftotext" and "sed" to search the text for the
DOI identifier, then to feed that to the fabulous 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/">ADS database</a> to get the
ADS-supplied BibTeX entry directly.  
</p><p>
			<!-- <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100616150150/http://stuff.mit.edu/people/lucylim/pdf2doi_ads.txt"> -->
<a href="https://github.com/lucyflim/www/blob/master/getDOIfromPDF_newADS.applescript">
Updated applescript for the new ADS</a>
</p><p>		
   There's also a script <a href="https://github.com/lucyflim/www/blob/master/dxdoiorg.applescript">to send the
		DOI to dx.doi.org instead</a>, if ADS doesn't suit your needs.
</p>
In order for either of these to work, you'll have to have pdftotext and curl installed
on your system.  I think curl comes with OS X; pdftotext can be installed
from brew in the xpdf package:
<pre>$ brew install xpdf</pre>
in which case it'll probably be in /usr/local/bin/pdftotext,
and it might be in some other packages as well.
Depending on how it's been installed, you might have to change 
"xpdf-pdftotext" in the applescript to
"pdftotext" or whatever is the correct path.  If you don't
know the path, try typing "which pdftotext" or "which xpdf-pdftotext" in Terminal.
<p>
To use it:
</p><ol>
<li> Open a new entry in BibDesk and drag the PDF you want the bibliographic
information
for onto it.  (You can do this from either Finder or Preview -- if the
paper is already open in Preview, you can 
drag the icon from the titlebar.  This is handy if you've just 
downloaded-and-opened the PDF out of Firefox.)
</li><li>Then, either
<ul>
<li> open the applescript in Script Editor (it's in /Applications/Applescript) 
and push "Run" (make sure BibDesk is open and 
you've highlighted the BibDesk entry you want to retrieve first)
</li><li> or, save the Applescript into the ~/Library/Application 
Support/BibDesk/Scripts folder.  Then you can run it from within 
BibDesk's own Scripts menu.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<h3>DOI and regular expressions</h3>
<p>
	The main "sed" command used to search for the DOI is based on
	<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/dois-and-matching-regular-expressions/">
		the regex recommended by crossref</a>:
	<pre>/^10.\d{4,9}/[-._;()/:A-Z0-9]+$/i</pre>
	but I went with explicitly including
	"0-9" in place of "\d" and 
	lowercase "a-z" instead of relying on $/i:
	<pre>/^10.[0-9]{4,9}/[-._;()/:a-zA-Z0-9]+</pre>
  and also as it turned out the curly braces had to be escaped with
  backslashes, and also the LC_ALL=C prefix turned out to be needed at
  the command line (but not in the applescript) so that the actual sed
  command ended up looking like this:
	<pre>$ LC_ALL=C sed -n -e 's_.*\(10\.[0-9]\{4,9\}/[-._;()/:a-zA-Z0-9]*\).*_doi\1_p' </pre>
	In the applescript all the backslashes had to be doubled leaving the
	final product like this:
<br>
<!-- (1st try): </p><pre>sed -n -e 's_.*[Dd][Oo][Ii][:)] *\([[:digit:]][[:digit:]]*.[[:alnum:])(.-]*/[[:alnum:])(.-][[:alnum:]):(.-]*[[:alnum:]-]\).*_\1_p' -->
<!-- </pre> -->
<!-- (2nd try, in case the paper does not place "DOI" in front of the -->
<!-- identifier): <pre>sed -n -e 's_.* *\([[:digit:]][[:digit:]]\.[[:alnum:])(.-]*[[:alnum:])(.-][[:alnum:]):(.-]*[[:alnum:]-]\).*_\1_p' -->
	<pre>set theSedslashString to "'s_.*\\(10\\.[0-9]\\{4,9\\}/[-._;()/:a-zA-Z0-9]*\\).*_doi\\1_p'"	</pre>
