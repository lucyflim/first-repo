<h2>Music</h2>

  Here is the viola part to Mozart's "Kegelstatt" trio (K. 498)
transcribed for B-flat clarinet as well as treble clef.  Basically,
some friends and I wanted to play this piece, which was written for
violin or clarinet, viola, and piano, but what we actually had was
flutes, a clarinet, and a piano, hence the transcription.

Viola part, movement 3, for B-flat clarinet (Allegretto):

The parts may look pretty messy in a .pdf reader, but they should
print fine.  Gv also does a pretty good job of displaying them.

The digitized version of the second movement was unfortunately lost in a
hard drive crash.  Sorry, y'all.

If you would like to send me email, you can probably figure out one
of my email addresses from Cornell's website.  In an attempt to avoid
spambots, I'm not going to include a mailto link here.  Sorry about that.
